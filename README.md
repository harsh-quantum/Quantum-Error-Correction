# Quantum-Error-Correction


## This Project is about Quantum Error Correction 
We have divided the material to be covered as a part of this project into 4 notebooks


# Mid-Term Deliverables Report
Notebook1: We have given a run through of the basics of QUantum Computinhg for the uninitiated and then introduced the concept of Information, how is it relvant to the discussion of Quantum Error Correction, how QEC Codes are used for this purpose and what is to be expected from a good code. 


Notebook2 : covered the No Cloning Theorem in detail so to help the reder to appreciate the diffrent approach one has to take to design QEC codes as compared to designing Classical Error Correction Codes. Further, Implemented the Quantum Version Repetion Code in Qiskit and in a way that the reader can appreciate the use of Entanglement to bypass the hurdle created by the No Cloning Theorem. 

Going forward, We will be preparing notebook 3 and 4 as described in the project proposal.
