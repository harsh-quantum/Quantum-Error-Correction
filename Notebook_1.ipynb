    "The Major chunk of the theory of Quantum Mechanics was developed in the early 20th century when in 1900, A German Physicist Max Karl Plank (Also called the Father of Modern Physics)  gave his result on the quantization of light which was considered to be a continuous wave up until that point. This idea was cemented by the theoretical analysis of Huygens, who showed that wave nature of light is consistent with Ray Optics; and by Young's Double slit Experiment. However, later in 1905 Albert Einstein confirmed Plank's Hypothesis through his famous Photoelectric effect. This laid the foundation for the \"dual nature of light\". This \"dual nature\" was later extended to matter when in 1924, DeBroglie presented the notion of the matter wave as his phd thesis. The next few years followed with a lot of critisism, debate and scientists trying to explain the observed atomic phenomena with the help of semi-classical theory. In 1927, again a breakthrough was achieved with Heisenberg's famous “Uncertainty Principle”  which established an iunverse relation between the  relative precisions with which that we can measure the  velocity and position of a particle at the same time. These groundbreaking results were calling for a new formalism in the world of physics  which was presented by Irish Scientist Erwin Schrödinger with his \"Wave equation\", that controlled the evolution of a newly presented fundamental quantity, the \"Wave Function\" describing the state of the concerned system."

One can also note that uncertainty is inversely related with the probabilty of the event, if the probability is high you are more certain that the event will happen.
